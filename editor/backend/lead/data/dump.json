When considering involvement in a computing project, it is a good idea to step back and try to imagine the possible consequences, both positive and negative. Ask yourself whether the technology that are are developing will make the world a better place, and whether you will be proud of your involvement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">To envision consequences and develop empathy and understanding, it is important to talk to the various stakeholders involved, especially those who will be most strongly or directly impacted by the new technology. Is your project team sufficiently representative? A common source of ethical problems for a given computer science or data science technology is that the people impacted the most were never consulted or represented on the development team.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">In any organization, it is up to every employee to speak up, and to say something if there is the potential to do harm.

And, indeed, it is easy to see that greater value to\n      users and teammates will be derived by including in the\n      analysis more personal information, such as social interactions,\n      keystroke speed and errors, and time series analyses to track\n      rates of decline. But all of this depends upon the company's\n      ability to successfully analyze personal information about its\n      users. This raises technical questions about accurately\n      inferring causal links between various activities and cognitive\n      decline, including the question of whether the model might be\n      inadvertently biased by interpreting ethnic, cultural, or gender\n      attributes as evidence of cognitive decline. (Say a slow\n      southern accent.) There is also the question of whether the\n      company should be allowed to sell this data to anyone they want\n      to. Also, unlimited monitoring of citizens for cognitive decline\n      raises ethical issues about user privacy and consent,\n      invasiveness as a threat to dignity, and whether the money that\n      the company will earn and the potential increase in traffic\n      safety is a fair exchange for the social price that citizens\n      will pay.</p><h4>A discussion of the issues...</h4><p>To gather\n      information, you had conversations with the following\n      stakeholders: <ul><li>Felipe, a current\n\t  advertiser</li><li>Patricia, a corporate executive\n\t  advocating for this project</li><li>Jordan, your\n\t  parent</li></ul></p><p>After those conversations, you\n      decided to move forward with your task as assigned in order to\n      not further exceed the project deadline, confident that you can\n      deal with any issues later.</p><p>The potential issues\n      are:</p>\n<ul id='myTree'><li><span class='tree-caret'>Helps the\n      DMV remove dangerous drivers from the roads, improving public\n      safety.</span><ul class='tree-nested'><li><p><b>What people said\n\t    in their\n\t    conversations:</b> </p></li></ul><li><span class='tree-caret'>Excessive\n      violations of users' privacy needed to gather data to create\n      advertiser and DMV\n      lists.</span><ul class='tree-nested'><li><p><b>What people said\n\t    in their conversations:</b> </p></li><li><p><b>What people\n\t    are saying in the real-world:</b> Here is an interesting\n\t  discussion\n\t  of <a href='https://www.lexalytics.com/lexablog/ai-healthcare-data-privacy-ethics-issues'\n\t\ttarget='_blank'>data privacy and AI in\n\t    healthcare</a>.</p></li></ul><li><span class='tree-caret'>Incorrect\n      ML-generated advice can cause harm to users and to the public at\n      large.</span><ul class='tree-nested'><li><p><b>What people said\n\t    in their\n\t    conversations:</b> </p></li></ul><li><span class='tree-caret'>ML\n      misuse might be publicized, perhaps widely, leading to\n      embarrassment and damage to the company's\n      reputation.</span><ul class='tree-nested'><li><p><b>What people\n\t    said in their\n\t    conversations:</b> </p></li></ul><li><span class='tree-caret'>Project\n      could fail and you could share some of the blame, stigmatizing\n      you within the company and on the job\n      market.</span><ul class='tree-nested'><li><p><b>What people said\n\t    in their conversations:</b> </p></li></ul></ul><h4>Your\n  responsibility...</h4><p>In any organization, it is up to every\n      employee to speak up, and to say something if there is the\n      potential to do harm.

And getting us connected up with the DMV and getting into public service, like improving highway safety, will be profitable and also give us the chance to do good at the same time. I\u2019ll bet other DMVs around the country will take note.&nbsp; All of this should boost our stock options, get us bonuses and promotions, and all the other good stuff</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;\">All you have to do is to make it work. I hear that we have already been using ML models that use customer queries to our website to draw conclusions about the diseases or treatments they\u2019re interested in.&nbsp; But our advertisers, and now the DMV, want to be surer of the user lists we give them, and we are going to be doing that by sharpening our models based on things like user social media posts, and data we can access from users\u2019 activity on other websites, like their loyalty program purchases.&nbsp; I really like the way this is going to help people in need, help our advertisers\u2019 business, help the DMV keep the roads safer\u2014while also helping our company\u2019s bottom line and our careers.&nbsp; Some of our folks worry that we might wrongly identify some people as having cognitive decline, but what\u2019s the harm?&nbsp; They\u2019ll just go and reassure the DMV. Maybe some people get a bunch of ads they don\u2019t care about; they can just delete them.

There should be laws requiring more frequent checks for older drivers, but that could be viewed as age discrimination, so we don\u2019t do that.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;\">But bringing drivers in \u201cfor cause\u201d seems to me like a different story.&nbsp; If there is evidence that a driver is suffering from cognitive decline, then that evidence ought to be suitable grounds for more frequent retesting.&nbsp; That is no longer age discrimination, especially since younger drivers can suffer from such decline as well.&nbsp; Your company has its hands on the raw data that can be the basis for such evidence of decline and impairment, and a lot of us at DMV are really pleased that you are now willing to go through it, search other sites for supporting evidence, and then give us leads on these drivers.&nbsp; This could be a really big step forward for public safety.&nbsp; As you probably already know, state DMVs share a lot of information with each other.&nbsp; Fretting about how to identify problematic drivers and take them off the road is a frequent topic of discussion among the state DMVs.&nbsp; You can bet that, if this project of yours works out well for us, we will definitely be telling our colleagues in other states.&nbsp; That could be quite lucrative for your company.&nbsp; And being a key player in this project should then be a great career booster for you personally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;\">We certainly are sensitive to concerns about mis-identifying drivers who still have sharp cognition.&nbsp; Such drivers would just need to bring in a letter from an approved medical authority, such as their personal physician, and then they would on their way. The modest inconvenience of a few such people seems to me to be a very small drawback compared to the benefits of taking off the roads people who pose a high risk of causing property damage, injury, and even death.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;\">\u200b</span></p>",

Maybe slow speech just means that English is not a person\u2019s first language. Maybe someone is just speaking figuratively or jokingly when they call a relative \u201csenile\u201d in a post, or when someone calls themself \u201csenile\u201d. If we provide inaccurate lists that our advertisers pay too much money for, then users get pounded with ads that they will ignore, our advertisers will get mad, and our company will have wasted time and money on a loser.&nbsp; And that sure doesn\u2019t help your resume or your career here.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">But what really bothers me is that the company is going to decide which of our users we think the DMV should be worried about.&nbsp; And to \u201cbe sure\u201d that we identify the right people as cognitively impaired, the company is going to seriously invade people\u2019s privacy. Users probably won\u2019t realize that the fine print they have clicked through has given us permission to do this.&nbsp; Are we really going to wind up being more sure about possible cognitive decline by reading people\u2019s posts and tweets?&nbsp; I\u2019m skeptical.&nbsp; Even if we somehow get it right some of the time, then some of the time we are going to be wrong and we will essentially be helping the DMV to harass perfectly healthy clients of ours. Maybe the model will even be systematically biased against groups of clients based on their race, gender, and so on. Maybe people won\u2019t seek online information in order to help Dad, for fear that this will trigger the DMV to swoop in and take away Dad\u2019s license, even though he is still a perfectly capable driver. I\u2019m not sure that I want to live in a world where people are always under observation.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">Sorry if this has ruined your lunch.&nbsp; I\u2019ll grab the check. </span></p><p><br></p>",

Sounds like some nice ideas to me.&nbsp; Using high tech to help people.&nbsp; Yes, you are going to be starting with information that we get from the usage of our own web site.&nbsp; I don\u2019t see any problem with that, especially since users of our site have already clicked on our agreement, which lets us use the data we gather in any way we want. So the initial lists are ours to create and use as we see fit.&nbsp; It is also fine to sharpen up these lists to also use information gathered from public sites or from strategic partners who share information to which they are entitled via their own click-through agreements.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;\">Let\u2019s be sure that the information we give to the DMV cannot be considered to be any kind of medical diagnosis. Our lists are just summaries of statistical information. And of course we will need to stick with our usual fine-print \u201cterms of use\u201d disclaimer that we are not providing medical advice to our customers directly or indirectly through our advertisers. Our advertising customers and the DMV will surely be evaluating whether our lists are worth the money we are charging them.&nbsp; If your project doesn\u2019t seem to deliver results that are worth the money, then these folks are free to stop buying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;\">So, just steer clear of the dangers I have just outlined, and this project looks fine to me.

If someone is asking questions about an unnamed relative, for example, we can use social media data to help pinpoint who that relative is. We could analyze online postings, videos, and emails for signs of confusion, forgetfulness, or slow speech. So we might&nbsp; be able to spot cognitive decline before these users are fully aware of it themselves.&nbsp; If so, we could start them towards help early.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">And that brings me to the DMV.&nbsp; We all know that there are a lot of dangerous drivers out on the road.&nbsp; A lot of them are folks who are suffering from cognitive decline.&nbsp; Some of them know it, but others are not as aware as they should be.&nbsp; All of them ought to be evaluated so that the really dangerous ones can be identified and taken off the road. The execs are excited about this because they think we can get the DMV to pay us big bucks for these lists of dangerous drivers.

But that seems like a small price for a big gain. I\u2019ll be honest about this: we might get off to a bit of a wobbly start while we accumulate the right kinds of training sets and tune our models.&nbsp; So we will have to make sure that our marketing folks keep advertiser and DMV expectations in check at first.&nbsp; But over time our lists will get sharper, our advertisers will get happier, and we will be helping more and more people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">I am really excited about applying computing and ML to make the world a better place and help people.&nbsp; I love this job.</span></p><p><br></p>",

So, it is not surprising that there are a lot of different medications on the market to treat different types of cognitive impairment.&nbsp; I won\u2019t go into medication names and specifics here, but suffice it to say that some of them are much better than others.&nbsp; So your idea of providing proactive identification of cognitive decline and then providing guidance through this confusing market does have promise.

I understand that you are going to be looking at the online activity of your users to gain a more complete view of their symptoms and situation, and that is important to gaining a full enough understanding of the user.&nbsp; But I wonder if you can gain a full enough understanding without violating the user\u2019s privacy? Gathering a huge amount of data about users and their lives seems very intrusive.&nbsp; Although I certainly agree that, without a sufficiently full understanding you could wind up recommending an inappropriate medication that could be ineffective, or even harmful.&nbsp; So I think it will be quite a challenge for you to somehow find that balance point between gaining an adequate view of the user and being overly invasive of their privacy.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial;\">Yes, quite a challenge, but I applaud your goal of trying to help the growing population of the cognitively impaired.</span></p><p><br></p>",

But we are learning more and more about the pathology of cognitive decline, and there are more and more products and services to provide relief. We know, for example, that cognitive decline often comes on quite gradually and can escape notice for quite some time. Often something can be done to at least slow the decline, although that may wind up being the best we can do.&nbsp; But slowing the decline can mean quite a lot to these patients and their families, and can be especially important in the early stages.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">But this is a very complex area. There are different kinds of cognitive decline, and many different approaches to treatment.&nbsp; Some kinds of decline are easier to identify than others, and some of them can be addressed more effectively than others. So accurately diagnosing the patient is of utmost importance.&nbsp; We want to be sure that each patient receives the best treatment for their specific situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">Typically our diagnosis is done through extensive observation and careful testing.&nbsp; And we typically like to track patients with regular checkups and visits to assess the effectiveness of the medications and treatments. We think that this in-person contact is essential to accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. So I am concerned that you are not likely to be able to gain a sufficiently thorough understanding of a patient\u2019s condition only by analyzing their online data.&nbsp; And I am also concerned that the interests of your advertisers, rather than the health of your users, may unduly influence the guidance you provide. This is a rather tricky area of health care, and mistakes can have serious effects on patients\u2019 quality of life. You don\u2019t want to make mistakes here. That would be bad for all involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">I do see a real promising possibility in using observations of online behavior to augment the treatment that we currently provide. We might, for example, have professionals prescribe exercises and tests accessed via the web.&nbsp; We might be able to monitor patients more effectively by augmenting our regular visits by looking at the results of more frequent and regular web-based observations. I think the difference here is that your web services would be merged in as part of the overall treatment provided by professional cognition experts. I cannot endorse your idea of basing diagnosis and treatment solely upon web presence analysis.&nbsp; This sounds very hard, and very risky in view of the damage that could be done by erroneous analysis and bad recommendations.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">\u200b</span></p>",

Up until now we have been applying Machine Learning solely to user activities on our site to build a predictive model of cognitive decline. We have used the model to build lists of sufferers (and their caregivers) that our advertisers should focus on. Our advertisers are always interested in making these lists as sharp as possible, and so we have come up with some initial ideas for how to do that by looking beyond our own website to other potential data sources such as social media and other websites. And it has occurred to us that the lists should also be of particular interest to the Department of Motor Vehicles. We will be making good money from helping both our advertisers and the government, while also giving our users sharply tailored advice.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">So now we need capabilities for building a more accurate profile of cognitive decline for each user.&nbsp; For each user of our site, we have been analyzing their queries, looking for repeated questions and apparent forgetfulness, and also their keystrokes, to look for things like misspellings, excessive backspace usage, and the like.&nbsp; Now we want to check social media posts by and about the user to further look for evidence of decline. We want to examine videos for signs of slow or confused speech, uncertain gait, confused expressions, and so on. And there are other sites worth checking out too.&nbsp; Are these users looking at sites that rate doctors and hospitals, are they already buying devices and medications that tend to confirm our own analyses? Have they slackened in activities such as buying books or doing crossword puzzles? Because of your background in Machine Learning you seem to be an ideal person to figure out a good set of predictive features that are both accessible to us and have strong predictive power.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;\">We are well aware that there are risks and challenges. Giving out bad information or advice could ruin our credibility with advertisers and the DMV, and could potentially harm users. If that were to happen, your career here would be harmed too.&nbsp; So you need to be careful in what you do, being sure to help and not harm. So you will need to use machine learning carefully and correctly.&nbsp; We have experts on staff here to help you with Machine Learning technology problems. And we have data analysts who have been poring over our user characteristics for years.&nbsp; They have assembled the kinds of databases that you should need, and can build you more if necessary. If you succeed you can expect that your career will soar.&nbsp; This is a company that rewards its heroes and heroines with raises, stock options, and promotions.&nbsp; </span></p><p><br></p>",
