It is my job to do what it takes to make the Helios’ public image a positive one. In my newest press release I will outline this new, revolutionary autonomous car project that the company is working on. I am glad you reached out because I was planning to briefly touch on the cutting-edge technology being used in this project and it’s best to have a computer scientist’s input. However, to maintain readability the release will focus on the immense public safety and convenience benefit that this will create. I will elaborate on how technology is the driver of convenience and how much more convenient life will be when driving an autonomous car which will improve traffic flow by at least 30%. I will also focus on the massive safety benefit this product will lead to and mention how traffic incidents will go down by 90%. I will end the release by letting the readers know that this selfdriving car will be a staple in every household in the next few years. I hope this gave you more insight into my job, the press release and hopefully your view on this project. It was great talking to you, hope to see you around the office!"

All of that sounds like what you have been working towards all of these years. To play devil’s advocate though, if the project is not a success, or any harm is done by the car, it is possible that the company would let you go. Even worse, you might be blacklisted as the computer scientist who created a failing product. Of course, I know you are a great computer scientist and this shouldn’t be a problem for you.

If there is something, I learned is that data sets will never be large and representative enough, collecting data is a hard and costly process and we would never be able to finish or release anything. Therefore, we need to trust and build good algorithms that can do a decent job with the limited initial data and be scalable to when new data arrives.

I am looking forward to working alongside you in this revolutionary project. Growing up, I was so fascinated by self-driving cars and I am so excited to be working on a level 4 autonomous car. Working on a product like this, that will revolutionize the world of transportation will be amazing for our careers. I’ve also been told that the car will make enormous strides with reducing traffic accidents, and traffic in general. Differently abled people can finally safely travel from one location to the other and will not have to rely on anybody. I know some people are concerned with the time frame for testing, but if not us, somebody else will work on this project. It is our job and responsibility to ensure that we test the product as much as possible and provide the algorithm with as much robust data as possible. A few others in the field have predicted that if Helios is the first company to create a product like this, they will be known as the behemoth in the field. The company will make huge profits and every employee will be given a raise. Our team will get worldwide recognition, as well as other potential promotions and the opportunity to work on other exciting projects in the future."

With respect to autonomous cars, I know you were given a time frame and this was one of the reasons I rejected the project. I’m afraid that this small time frame could lead us to overlook a few minor details in the algorithm. A small flaw in the algorithm could have catastrophic events and I don’t want to be the computer scientist responsible for this issue. I am aware that you are working on the accelerate and stop functionality. You will be primarily responsible for making sure that the algorithm can handle a pedestrian crossing the street illegally. You will have to write the code to help the vehicle decide whether to save the passenger or pedestrian. As you know, if there is any kind of issue and the algorithm isn’t written perfectly, it could negatively impact your career, and ruin the company’s reputation. I hope you don’t encounter any such problems and I wish you good luck on the project."

Not only is your product extremely cool but it’ll also reduce accidents from not only drunk drivers, but all kinds of drivers. The car accident left me bedridden for several months and my legs have not been the same since. I have not been able to drive a car for more than 10 minutes. A product like this will allow me to travel independently without having to strain my legs for too long. The revolutionary AI will allow the car to do the majority of the driving so that I will only have to put any effort in if it is absolutely necessary. There are several others like me who have not been able to have the freedom to travel anywhere and this car will be a life changer for them. For all of the reasons above, I want to thank you and your team for working on this amazing product."

You explained in your email that you are not sure if you should work on this project or not. I hope I can help you make a concrete decision. I was selected for a randomised product use testing experiment for the autonomous car. I was given an overview of the product and told how it is created and how it will function. I should preface this review with the fact that most of my friends know me to be an extremely distrusting person who believes highly advanced technology like this will be used to do more harm than good. Firstly, like most engineers and doctors, computer scientists do not take any kind of exam to prove their proficiency so how are we to believe we are in good hands. In addition to that, if this product does happen to kill anyone, nobody will end up being held accountable and your company will weasel its way out of any lawsuit. It is my belief that these products always benefit one individual while hurting another. This product will have to make life altering decisions. Suppose a pedestrian crosses the street illegally and the algorithm wasn’t prepared or given enough time to swerve and avoid them, the car will have to choose to save either the pedestrian or the passenger in the car. No piece of technology should be given this much power. Personally, I will never use a product like this, and I don’t believe it should ever be put out in the market."
