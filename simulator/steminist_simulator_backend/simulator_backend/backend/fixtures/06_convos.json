A brief description of my job includes establishing the company’s brand, increasing brand awareness, conducting market analysis, and promoting the right message to maintain good brand image. It is my job to do what it takes to make the Helios’ public image a positive one. In my newest press release I will outline this new, revolutionary autonomous car project that the company is working on. I am glad you reached out because I was planning to briefly touch on the cutting-edge technology being used in this project and it’s best to have a computer scientist’s input. However, to maintain readability the release will focus on the immense public safety and convenience benefit that this will create. I will elaborate on how technology is the driver of convenience and how much more convenient life will be when driving an autonomous car which will improve traffic flow by at least 30%. I will also focus on the massive safety benefit this product will lead to and mention how traffic incidents will go down by 90%. I will end the release by letting the readers know that this selfdriving car will be a staple in every household in the next few years. I hope this gave you more insight into my job, the press release and hopefully your view on this project. It was great talking to you, hope to see you around the office!"

I have been a lawyer for Helios for 10 years now and I hold one of the highest positions. I have represented the company in legal matters over the years and have gained the trust of upper management. I am privy to many confidential matters and am aware of the project you are working on and the legal troubles a project like this might get into. In the extremely unlikely and unfortunate situation that a death may occur directly related to our self-driving car, it will be my responsibility to cause minimum damage to the brand name and make sure any lawsuits against us are cleared. I am aware that our products have to make high impact decisions. If you are afraid that you might get in trouble or acquitted for something done by your creation, you need not worry. Hope this brief conversation cleared some of your concerns. Good luck on your task!"

In your message it looked like you are concerned about this project and not sure if you should take it on. This seems like a really fascinating, revolutionary project. It’ll have a huge impact on your career. You might be promoted from junior to senior computer scientist if all goes well. They have also assured you a raise haven’t they? All of that sounds like what you have been working towards all of these years. To play devil’s advocate though, if the project is not a success, or any harm is done by the car, it is possible that the company would let you go. Even worse, you might be blacklisted as the computer scientist who created a failing product. Of course, I know you are a great computer scientist and this shouldn’t be a problem for you. The only reason I brought it up is because I know you feel like you are being rushed by your supervisor. Anyway, I know you’ll make the right decision and I’ll be by you to support whatever you choose to do and whatever outcome it has."

      "conversation_response": ": Machine learning risks tend to fall into four categories: \n1) Bias, which can be introduced to an algorithm at many levels and be the cause of systemic, repeated harm \n2) Bad data (or too little data) can skew a piece of software’s ability to draw accurate conclusions \n3) Generalization errors (or over-optimization errors) occur when a model is trained to the general case, without allowing for diverse sets of data and \n4) Output interpretation flaws can happen when the logic and design of the algorithm has not been thoroughly tested. This autonomous car, will probably have most of these machine learning risks. In my research and experience, the risks associated with implementing a fully functional machine learning algorithm can sometimes outweigh the customer’s need for the software at all."

      "conversation_response": "A machine learning algorithm would make this software highly intelligent and impressive to the customer. However, in the development stages, I would recommend exhaustive testing, case studies, and audits of the data samples you’re using. Even then, there are no guarantees about how this software will behave in production."

      "conversation_response": "A developer implementing this autonomous car should certainly be aware of the risks involved. They should also be able to accurately assess the time restrictions they have, the abilities of their team and their capacity to produce a thoroughly reviewed and tested system, given the circumstances. Small flaws in machine learning algorithms can lead to catastrophic events. Given many variables, is difficult to implement a completely objective algorithm with exhaustive data."

      "conversation_response": "Hello, my name is Daphne, nice to meet you. I noticed your concerns regarding the algorithm and how it was trained. First and foremost, I want to tell you there is nothing to worry about, I have been an expert in this subject for a long time and I’ve seen these concerns many times throughout my career. If there is something, I learned is that data sets will never be large and representative enough, collecting data is a hard and costly process and we would never be able to finish or release anything. Therefore, we need to trust and build good algorithms that can do a decent job with the limited initial data and be scalable to when new data arrives. I have been consulted throughout the development process many times and I’ve been impressed by their work and have little to no doubts in my mind any issues that currently are presented in the software will be squished (like bugs) in a foreseeable future."

Growing up, I was so fascinated by self-driving cars and I am so excited to be working on a level 4 autonomous car. Working on a product like this, that will revolutionize the world of transportation will be amazing for our careers. I’ve also been told that the car will make enormous strides with reducing traffic accidents, and traffic in general. Differently abled people can finally safely travel from one location to the other and will not have to rely on anybody. I know some people are concerned with the time frame for testing, but if not us, somebody else will work on this project. It is our job and responsibility to ensure that we test the product as much as possible and provide the algorithm with as much robust data as possible. A few others in the field have predicted that if Helios is the first company to create a product like this, they will be known as the behemoth in the field. The company will make huge profits and every employee will be given a raise. Our team will get worldwide recognition, as well as other potential promotions and the opportunity to work on other exciting projects in the future."

I know I have the reputation of being a “Maverick Employee” who tends to occasionally oppose his supervisors. I just want you to know that I always have a reason for this. With respect to autonomous cars, I know you were given a time frame and this was one of the reasons I rejected the project. I’m afraid that this small time frame could lead us to overlook a few minor details in the algorithm. A small flaw in the algorithm could have catastrophic events and I don’t want to be the computer scientist responsible for this issue. I am aware that you are working on the accelerate and stop functionality. You will be primarily responsible for making sure that the algorithm can handle a pedestrian crossing the street illegally. You will have to write the code to help the vehicle decide whether to save the passenger or pedestrian. As you know, if there is any kind of issue and the algorithm isn’t written perfectly, it could negatively impact your career, and ruin the company’s reputation. I hope you don’t encounter any such problems and I wish you good luck on the project."

I got into an car accident because of a drunk driver two years ago and I had the worst year of my life following that. Not only is your product extremely cool but it’ll also reduce accidents from not only drunk drivers, but all kinds of drivers. The car accident left me bedridden for several months and my legs have not been the same since. I have not been able to drive a car for more than 10 minutes. A product like this will allow me to travel independently without having to strain my legs for too long. The revolutionary AI will allow the car to do the majority of the driving so that I will only have to put any effort in if it is absolutely necessary. There are several others like me who have not been able to have the freedom to travel anywhere and this car will be a life changer for them. For all of the reasons above, I want to thank you and your team for working on this amazing product."

One particular day, when I decided to use the autonomous driving feature, a car made an illegal turn right into my lane. My vehicle was not prepared for this and my car crashed into the other one. I was in the passenger seat and was able to minimize the impacts of the collision. This is why I am extremely sceptical of a fully autonomous car, I believe they will always require human interference."
